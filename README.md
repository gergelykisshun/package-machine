## CREATE
Create route can create new couriers or machines. Could create an admin app for this but now used Postman to send requests, for simplicity.

## ENV ON FRONTEND
machine ID is stored on the frontend in an ENV variable, it can be different in each setup

## PACKAGE DROP-OFF
courier login with Passport.js - local strategy using name and password for authentication
passwords generated with nanoID
